                        a new unique ID will be generate and will check against the file line by line to check if the ID

                        file the search term word for that criteria. Furthermore, if the user don't check any checkbox
                        then the system will search for that string in all criteria.

                        I didn't join any discussion point in the unit's discussion board because throughout the process
                        of doing the lab, I have understood the use of the built-in function of PHP so that I can
                        research a little bit beyond that to apply to the Assignment 1.
